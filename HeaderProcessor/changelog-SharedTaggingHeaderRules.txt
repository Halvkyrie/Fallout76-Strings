Shared Strings Tagging Header Rules Changelog
4.7.4
Added subcategory a for C2. Added chems not included in subcategory b to subcategory a
Added subcategory c for C2. Moved Formula P here, as it is more or less exclusively crafted

Fixed NWOT rule main rule missing %s and fallback having mismatching "include" rules causing it not to catch anything
Added subcategory a for C0. Currently has Stimpak and RadAway: Diluted
Added Addictol, Antibiotics, Disease Cure to C0 subcategory c. this way all 3 groups can be handled individually for sale, drop etc.

4.7.1
Fixed missing check for Rad-X in C0 subcategory b


4.7
Redid NWOT rule to use fallback for more advanced ruling, and added Molerat Jerky by Form ID

Added tagging rule for regular chems. C0, C1, C2 as tiers, with optional subcategory b and c.
C0 is for the healing/aid type chems, C1 for normal/common chems, and C2 for the rare/higher tier chems
Subcategory b is for what's normally unwanted. Subcategory c is for what's more niche. dunno how useful c is


4.6.1
Changed NWOT rule to exclude Carnival Pie from its Form ID instead of keywords, as these caused some glaring issues I should have checked for.


4.6
Added NT rule for Gulper Smacker weapon + mod plans


4.5
Excluded ObjectTypeFish from RM tag, made separate fish tag instead
Excluded MealTypeTasty + IngredientTypeFruit from NWOT tag. Means that Carnival Pies are no longer tagged, since these now benefit from herbivore properly.

New Tags:
RF: Raw Fish
